# üõç Bootstrap Shopify Theme

A free [**Shopify Theme**](https://github.com/maxvien/bootstrap-shopify-theme) built with [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/), [BEM](http://getbem.com/), [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [ESNext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#ES.Next), [Theme Tools](https://shopify.dev/tools/themes), ... and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

## Experience

When I started building this Shopify theme, I thought it would be simple. But as I got deeper, I realized there was more to it.  

I build themes from scratch, using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create a clean, user-friendly interface. I follow the [BEM Methodology](http://getbem.com/), which helps keep my code minimal and reusable.  

I work with [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [ESNext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#ES.Next) to keep the theme modern and flexible. When problems arise, [Shopify Theme Scripts](https://github.com/Shopify/theme-scripts) help me solve them faster. I also use [Shopify Metafield](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/metafield) to add extra details where needed.  

For visuals, I rely on [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) to create smooth, touch-friendly sliders and [CSS Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) to ensure a responsive, mobile-first design.  

To streamline development, I use the [Shopify Theme CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli) for deployment and [Webpack Encore](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore) to bundle assets. [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) and [CoreJS](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) help keep the theme compatible with older browsers.  

And of course, I follow best practices with [Shopify Theme Check](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/theme-check), [ESlint](https://eslint.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)‚Äîbecause clean code makes everything easier.  

It‚Äôs a process. A learning curve. But in the end, it‚Äôs about crafting themes that work beautifully‚Äîfor both the store owner and the customer.

### Webpack Encore

[Symfony Webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html) is a simpler way to integrate Webpack into your application.
